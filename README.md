# python-cmd-matrix-screensaver
A screensaver created with python which will emulate the "raining code" in The Matrix Movies. This program runs solely on the command line

It is recommended to change the cmd font colour to green to better emulate the style from the movie.
This can be done by right-clicking the top of the cmd window and selecting 'properties'.
